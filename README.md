Abstract: Something like this was bound to happen...

Background: I absolutely fell in love with Gentoo several years ago, and the recent addition of its stage3's on Dockerhub only makes life easier. This dockerized build-system creates an optimized buildmaster from the publicly-available Gentoo stages. This app is a little less straightforward than a standard webapp. For example, one complication is that our output targets aren't usually other Docker containers.

Temporary note: Most of the work is checked into tne dev branch and we can expect a merge for the rest of the pipeline within a day or so; I've been crafting it intelligently so as to not require (much) rework in the future. More instructions will be forthcoming!

Our docker-compose file creates persistent volumes for:
``
/var/cache/binpkg
/var/cache/distfiles
/var/db/repos/gentoo
``

Everything else is mounted into the container via bind mounts. Permissions are minded such that we won't experience any stomping. Some files are autogenerated from templates files, hence the name AutoGentoo! :)


At present we can consider this thing alpha: Once your config is written down, only very minor changes will be needed.

Feel free to also use this as documentation for your own work!
