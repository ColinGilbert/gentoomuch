This folder allows you, the enduser, to mask and default-install packages and set use-flags for specific profiles.
This is to afford a quick way of fixing upstream bugs, when dealing with experimental stages.
We will further refine this functionality to include a fuller span of operations, including package-specific patches
This will not only help an individual user to quickly overcome her blockers, but also allows the community to test out each others' patches prior to filing/confirming upstream bug reports
Huzzah for that!
