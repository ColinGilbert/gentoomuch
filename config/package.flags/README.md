Here, package-flag and global portage-related setting are defined. Files such as ``package.use``, ``package.accept_keywords``, ``package.mask``, ``package.unmask``, but each make.conf variable is written-out in uppercase; these merely get read into the final make.conf file, and sent to our build-system. This may change, but it probably won't: If the user wrote these variables into their own make.conf and it simply worked, that person might expect the file to be copied directly into the staging environment and may end up with surprises... Unlike with the files listed above, it is most decidedly _not_ the case and with the current layout, the user can quickly infer that fact.
